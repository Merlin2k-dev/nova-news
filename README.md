# NovaNews - Tech News Web Prototype

NovaNews is a modern, clean, and AI-focused news website designed to deliver the latest in artificial intelligence, tech trends, and futuristic happenings. This is the Phase 2 working prototype for our web development project.

## 🧠 What It Is

A simple static website built with HTML & CSS (no frameworks yet). The layout, visual design, and content are based directly on the Figma prototype made earlier. It’s meant to showcase core layout structure, user interface ideas, and navigation planning for the final product.

## 🔧 What Works

- Fully responsive header, navigation bar, and search field
- Hero section with breaking news banner and background image
- 3 dynamically styled article cards (with real Unsplash images)
- About section explaining NovaNews' purpose
- Fully styled footer
- Adaptive layout for mobile

---

## 🔜 What’s Coming

- Linkable article pages (right now the "Read More" buttons don’t go anywhere)
- Search functionality (it’s just a field for now)
- Real content management, database, or CMS integration
- Login/registration and personalized content
- Full backend connection (maybe React later on)

## 📎 Notes

This submission is part of the Phase 2 requirement for the course. The prototype is complete with core functionality and ready for testing. Some features were intentionally left to be added in Phase 3.
